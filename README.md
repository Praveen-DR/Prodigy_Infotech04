**Pixel Manipulation for Image Encryption**
Pixel manipulation for image encryption involves altering the RGB values of each pixel in an image using cryptographic algorithms, making the image unreadable without proper decryption. This process obscures the content of the image while maintaining its overall visual structure. Decryption reverses the changes, restoring the original image using the correct decryption key or algorithm.

**Encryption Process**
Encryption is the process of converting data or information into a secret code to prevent unauthorized access, ensuring privacy and security.

Image Selection: Choose an image to encrypt. Byte Array Conversion: Convert the image into a byte array, transforming the image data into numeric form. XOR Operation: Apply the XOR operation to each value in the byte array using an encryption key. This operation changes the data, making it inaccessible without the key. Key Importance: The encryption key is crucial as it acts like a password. Without it, decryption is impossible.

**Decryption Process**
Decryption is the reverse of encryption, where the encrypted image data is converted back to its original form using the correct decryption key.

Key Application: Use the correct decryption key to apply the inverse XOR operation on the byte array. Restoring the Image: Convert the byte array back to the original image format.
